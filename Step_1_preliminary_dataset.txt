We have created a preliminary dataset of images containing spread out Wheat grains.

'Pure' folder contains images having grain with no impurities.
'Impure' folder has images containing both grain and impurities.

Our first task is to segment out each grain from all the images. Once we are able to do that, a bigger dataset will be built 
and we'll work on the next step.
